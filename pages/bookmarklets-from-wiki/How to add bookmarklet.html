To add the Miro bookmarklet, simply drag the following link and drop it somewhere on your bookmarks bar:
<h2><a href="javascript:void%20function(){miro.board.getSelection().then(a=%3Enavigator.clipboard.writeText(JSON.stringify(a,null,2)))}();">#miro</a></h2>
If you don't use a bookmark bar, you can still add and use this bookmarklet in other ways...

First you should copy the bookmarklet's content by right-clicking on the link above and copying the link's address. Then click CTRL/CMD+D, which on most browser's will open a menu to save the current page as a bookmark. On Chrome I had to hit "more", because what you want to be able to do it paste what you just copied into the URL field of the bookmark you are about to create (and not actually bookmark the page you just happened to be on in your tab). You can be a little crafty in how you decide name the bookmark. If you use a # sign, or give the bookmark a unique name that you will remember, then you will be able to execute your new bookmarklet from the browser's address bar. As you type the name of your new bookmark, it will be offered to you as an autocomplete option, and clicking this will actually run the bookmarklet for you in the same way that clicking the bookmarklet in the bookmarks bar would do. This, conveniently, also works across all of your devices if you use the same browser on them, like chrome for example, and you enable your bookmarks to be synced between devices.
